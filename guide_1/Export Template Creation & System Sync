Walkthrough - Export Template Creation & System Sync
I have created a dummy template for Export data and synchronized the entire application with the new 34-column database schema.

Changes Made
1. Frontend Template Generation
Updated 
ExcelUploadModal.tsx
 so that the "Download Template" button now generates an Excel file with the exact headers from your 
schema.sql
.

Match Guaranteed: Since the template headers now match the database column names (s_no, job_no, etc.), uploading data is now seamless.
Import & Export: Both modules now use the standardized 34-column format.

2. Backend Data Models
Updated 
ExportModel.ts
 and 
ImportModel.ts
 to include specifically typed definitions for all 34 columns.

Dates: Properly typed as 
Date
.
Values: Properly typed as number.

3. Controller Refactoring
Updated 
exportController.ts
 and 
importController.ts
 to support the new schema across all operations:

Bulk Upload: Redesigned to map your new template headers directly to the database.
CRUD: Updated Create and Update endpoints to handle all 34 fields.

4. Analytics Synchronization
Updated 
analyticsController.ts
 to use the new column names (container_size, invoice_value) so your dashboard charts continue to work correctly.

Recommendations for Permissions
I noticed you commented out the GRANT statements in 
schema.sql
. If you are still seeing "permission denied" errors, please run these commands manually in your database tool (pgAdmin/psql) as a superish/postgres user:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE import_data TO freight_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE export_data TO freight_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SEQUENCE import_data_id_seq TO freight_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SEQUENCE export_data_id_seq TO freight_user;
Verification Results
"Download Template" generates correct headers.
Bulk upload logic is synchronized with the new template.
Analytics queries reflect the updated schema.
